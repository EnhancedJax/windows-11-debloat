# Windows 11 Debloater 🚀

✔️ Before running this script, make sure to backup all your important files! ✔️

❌ Don't run this script without backing up your data. Yes, script makes restore point but that might not be enough! ❌

This script is based of my Windows 10's debloater script. You can find it [here!](https://github.com/teeotsa/windows-10-debloat)

# Can you run it? ✔️

Well, depends. Beta & Dev builds of **Windows 11** should work fine with this script! Check below how to bypass version checking

Make sure you have updated version of **Windows 11** before running this script

# How to bypass version check?

If you want to run this script on newer version of **Windows 11** or even **Windows 10** then just open up the script
with notepad or something. Next up, find the line where ``$BypassWindowsVersionChecking = $True`` is and change ``$True`` to ``$False``
Like so :

After that, just save your script and run it again! This time, version check should be bypassed 😄
